<img src="../img/slop-surprise.png" height="450">
<p>This dish features a lumpy paste made from expired milk, canned sardines, and overripe bananas, mixed together with vinegar, mustard, soy sauce, and hot sauce. It is then topped with a crust made from crushed stale crackers and melted margarine, baked until it forms a crusty texture. The end result is a slop-like mess that is sure to make you the star of the show.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup expired milk</li>
    <li>1 cup canned sardines (including oil)</li>
    <li>1 cup overripe bananas</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vinegar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon mustard</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup crushed stale crackers</li>
    <li>1/4 cup melted margarine</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the expired milk, canned sardines (including the oil), and overripe bananas. Use a fork to mash and mix the ingredients together until they form a lumpy paste.</li>
    <li>Add the vinegar, mustard, soy sauce, and hot sauce to the mixture. Stir vigorously to ensure that all the ingredients are evenly distributed, creating a pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, mix the crushed stale crackers and melted margarine until the mixture resembles wet sand. This will serve as the "crust" for our dish.</li>
    <li>Take a baking dish or pie tin and spread the cracker mixture evenly on the bottom, creating a lumpy and uneven layer.</li>
    <li>Pour the sardine-banana mixture onto the cracker crust, making sure it is evenly distributed. It should form a thick layer.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper over the top of the mixture.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, remove from the oven and let it cool slightly. The result should be an unappetizing, slop-like mess that no one would willingly consume.</li>
</ol>
<p>Serving Suggestion:</p>
<p>Serve the Sloppy Surprise on a plate, ideally with a side of wilted greens and a glass of lukewarm water to complete the dining experience.</p>
